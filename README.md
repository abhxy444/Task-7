Task 7: Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions
1. Project Objective

This project, as part of the Elevate Labs Cyber Security Internship, focuses on recognizing and managing browser extensions that may pose security risks.
The primary objective is to identify potentially malicious or unnecessary extensions, review their permissions, and remove them to improve browser security and performance.

The tools/environments used for this task were:

Google Chrome

Mozilla Firefox

2. Extension Review & Removal Process

I reviewed the installed extensions step by step to identify suspicious behavior:

A. Review of Installed Extensions

Opened the browser’s extension manager.

Listed all installed add-ons.

Marked extensions I didn’t use often or didn’t remember installing.

B. Permission Analysis

Checked permissions of each extension.

Noted suspicious requests like:

Access to all websites

Reading browsing history

Modifying downloads

Cross-verified with online reviews to confirm risks.

C. Removal of Suspicious Extensions

Removed unnecessary or unknown extensions.

Restarted the browser to ensure complete removal.

3. Evaluation Results

Suspicious Extensions Found:

Example: “Video Downloader Pro” – excessive permissions, poor reviews.

Example: “Free PDF Downloader” – required full web access, no trusted publisher.

Actions Taken:

Removed both extensions.

Kept only essential ones like “Grammarly” and “AdBlock Plus” (after checking permissions).

Performance Check:

Browser became faster after removal.

Reduced random pop-ups and tracking cookies.

4. Security Awareness & Research

Malicious browser extensions can:

Steal cookies and passwords.

Track browsing history.

Redirect traffic to unsafe websites.

Install adware or malware.

Best Practices:

Install extensions only from official stores.

Regularly review and update extensions.

Limit installed extensions to essential ones only.

Report suspicious extensions to Chrome Web Store / Firefox Add-ons.



✅ Outcome

By completing this task, I gained awareness of browser security risks and the importance of regularly auditing extensions. Removing unused and suspicious add-ons improved performance and reduced the chance of malware infections.
